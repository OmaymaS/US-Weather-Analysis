This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. It mainly looks into the types of events that are most harmful with respect to population health (i.e. fatalities and injuries). In addition, it highlights the events affecting properties and crops resulting in severe economic consequences.
